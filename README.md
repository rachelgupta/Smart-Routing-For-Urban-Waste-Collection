# Smart-Routing-For-Urban-Waste-Collection

## 1. Problem
Municipal solid waste (MSW) is considered as one of the primary factors that contribute greatly to the rising of climate change and global warming affecting sustainable development in many different ways. It is indeed necessary to investigate an efficient computerized method for the optimization of MSW collection that minimizes the environmental and other factors according to a given waste collection scenario.

These wastes are collected by the garbage trucks and the problem with garbage trucks is that they need to go on a same route everyday even though there might be a chance that the dumpbin of some area might not be full enough. This cost trucks unnecessary diesel which they would have saved if they went to the same place after maybe a week or if they know when that bin would be filled. Also, as trucks follow a same route everyday, there is a possibility that they are unable to cover all the places in a day thus the places which might actually need cleaning is not been cleaned which in turn increases global warming.
